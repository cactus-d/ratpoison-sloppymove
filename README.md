# ratpoison-sloppymove

A companion program to ratpoison (https://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/) which causes the frame focus to follow the mouse movement

An improvement on the original "Sloppy Focus" packaged with ratpoison

Implements a compromise between "rat" and "no rat" -- changes focus based on rat movement but still allows for keyboard-based focus changes too, which the original Sloppy Focus inhibited

Based on the original Sloppy Focus by Shawn Betts <sabetts@vcn.bc.ca>
